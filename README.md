# ARKit-Demo

Project showing off some cool, easy to build Augmented Reality demos.

Demos include the following:
- Earth floating in an absolute position, rotating infront of the user (optionally adding an artificial light over top of the globe.
- Placing text ontop of a detected plane
- Placing a teddy bear ontop of a detected plane, with a mode to shoot small cubes at the bear and use physics that apply to both the bear and the cubes. The bear can be knocked off of the plane if cubes with the right force are applied to it!

## Branches: ##
- `master` which contains the final code
- `demo-starter` which contains a lot more commented code to walk through a demo showcasing adding lights to regular colored spheres and adding physics to the bear.
